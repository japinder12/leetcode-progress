# LeetCode Progress

This repo tracks my LeetCode practice: solutions, notes, and a simple progress log.

## Structure
- `problems/` → Code solutions organized by difficulty
  - `easy/`, `medium/`, `hard/`
- `notes/` → Patterns, approaches, and important takeaways
  - `patterns.md`, `dp.md`, `graphs.md`
- `progress.csv` → Log of problems solved (single source of truth)


## Conventions
- Naming: `problems/<difficulty>/<4-digit-id>-<problem-title>.py` (e.g., `problems/easy/0001-two-sum.py`)
- Commit per solution: `git commit -m "Add 0001 Two Sum (Easy) - hashmap solution"`
