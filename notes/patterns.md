# Patterns

Use this file to summarize common problem‑solving patterns and when to apply them.

## Sliding Window
- When: contiguous subarrays/substrings with constraints
- Template: maintain `left`, expand `right`, shrink while invalid

## Two Pointers
- When: sorted arrays, pair sums, in‑place partitioning

## Binary Search
- When: monotonic predicate, first/last true, search on answer

## Prefix/Suffix
- When: range sums, products, precompute to answer queries fast

## Graphs
- BFS for shortest steps in unweighted graphs
- DFS for traversal/components/toposort (with cycle checks)

## Dynamic Programming
- Identify state, transition, base cases, and ordering
