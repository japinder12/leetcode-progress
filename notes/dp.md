# Dynamic Programming

## Mindset
- State: what subproblem represents
- Transition: how states relate
- Base cases: trivial answers
- Ordering: recursion + memo or bottomâ€‘up tabulation

## Common Flavors
- 1D: climbing stairs, house robber
- 2D: edit distance, LCS, grid paths
- Knapsack: 0/1 vs unbounded
- Interval DP: merging, burst balloons

## Tips
- Prove overlapping subproblems + optimal substructure
- Reduce to O(1) space when only neighbors are needed
